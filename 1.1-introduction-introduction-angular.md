# Angular Course - Introduction - Introduction to Angular

## History

Angular exists since 2010 and was known as `AngularJS`.

Then, came 2014 with Angular 2.0, or what we call `Angular` today, starting in 2016.

`AngularJS` and `Angular` are very different and the following notes are about Angular only.

## Introduction

Angular is written in TypeScript and uses RxJS (handle reactivity).

## Architecture of an Angular applications

The building blocks are:

- modules : allow to group related code together, usually for features.
- components : serve a single as a small unit of code as an independent and isolated UI functionnality.

  - They need to stay small, clean, composable and reusable.
  - There are patterns to learn as one component can render to another. There is a dataflow and handling of immutable state is important to understand.
  - They shouldn't interact with the DOM (see directives for that).

- directives: they 2 things (1) add functionnality to HTML or components and (2) are in charge of rendering behavior (ex: conditionnal render or displaying a list).

  - There is built-in directives and you can customize yours.
  - The directives are the last layer before the DOM. They interact with the DOM.

- pipes : are pure functions that transform data for rendering.

  - The components use them
  - For example, it is about having a single entry point to format the same data over and over in the application (dates, currency, etc).
  - There is built-in pipes and you can customize yours as well.

- services: allow to retrieve the data.

  - The logic of service isn't component-related as they are generic classes.
  - So not only can they fetch data and store it in a state, if necessary, but they also can check authentication.
  - A service can consumme another one and they are used by components.
  - They have a singleton dependency, e.g. they are instancied once and shared in the application.

- a router: handles the route change. It basically instructs Angular to load a component or module based on the URL.
